    <h6>My favuorite vacation spot is Bengaluru</h6>
    <p> Bengaluru is known for its moderate and pleasant <b>climate</b> throughout the year. The city's elevation ensures that 
        it enjoys cooler temperatures compared to many other Indian cities, making it <b>comfortable</b> to live in.</p>
